# Analyis_using_SQL_Python

This notebook shows how to store a dataset into a database using and analyze data using SQL and Python. The objectives of this project is to:
* Understand a dataset of selected socioeconomic indicators in Chicago
* Learn how to store data in an Db2 database on IBM Cloud instance
* Solve example problems to practice your SQL skills
* Selected Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago

The city of Chicago released a dataset of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal. This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.

In this notebook, we'll take a look at the variables in the socioeconomic indicators dataset and do some basic analysis with Python.
